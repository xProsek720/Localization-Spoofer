# To create your own SSL Cert: 
```chmod +x make_cert.sh```
```./make_cert.sh```

# To forward ports use:
```chmod +x forward_ports.sh```
```./forward_ports.sh```

## How to get Good SSL Cert:

You can obtain host from cloudflare and then have SSL Certificate from Cloudflare
propably then it will work on iOs too.

## Working on:

- [x] PC
- [x] Android
- [ ] iOs (not tested with Cloudflare Setup)

## For forkers and contributors

- [ ] Feel free to try to make a nice looking website for that like a weather forecast.
- [ ] You can add some more info that will be spoofed and sent to the WebHook
- [ ] Add Terms of Service to the website to make it spoof localization legally

Enjoy and remember that it is propably illegal doing that without right of user to do that!
